# Crypto-Momentun-Portfolio

A momentum portfolio is portfolio based on investments which are performing best in terms of price / market cap.

In this analysis, I have procured data for the last 5 years and tried to analyse whether holding only Bitcoin is better than holding top ten cryptos by market cap and updating them every month.

I did find out that holding only Bitcoin was a good enough investment. But ETH is proved to be a better investment.

It is better to hold on to both of these asset classes for a better investment return.
